Continued. Few months of learning...

If you haven't read the part 1, you can read it [here](http://i5okie.github.io/learningrails/RailsLearningPath/) .

When I've been introduced to the Ruby language and one of its popular web frameworks, Rails, I've watched some quick tutorial videos and tried the [tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0). This was a few years back, before Rails and Merb joined forces to form Rails 3.
Since then I haven't really touched Ruby, or Rails, at least not seriously. Yeah, I've dabbed into CodeSchool's free Ruby course for a bit. I have made an app or two.. One didn't work out, and the other, with the help of a contributor from IRC, almost completed. It works, but it's still under development. I certainly wouldn't call it a finished product, but it works for its purpose.. [Redress](https://github.com/i5okie/redress). I only work on it when I have spare time at work. Not my pride and joy, but it's already gone through one re-write.

Alright, so the holidays were inspirational. At least in terms of getting me excited about diving into Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. The motivation is there, now what.

I've subscribed to [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/) and [TeamTreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home). From CodeSchool I've went through most of the Ruby learning path. It was alright, but for me it wasn't really cohesive enough. From there I went onto the TreeHouse and completed the Learn Ruby track, as well as Rails Development Track. I really liked these, and felt like I've learned something. However, It didn't feel enough.

IRC community is great, it's gotta be my one of my favourite parts of the whole Ruby on Rails 'experience' lol. Logging onto #rubyonrails and #ruby IRC, I've asked around. I said, okay so I've done these online courses. But it's not enough, what should I do now to upgrade my skills to be able to get a job?
The guys and gals on IRC have suggested several great ideas.

One of the more commonly recommended resources, available for free online, or purchase for a printed version is the [RailsTutorial book](https://www.railstutorial.org/). I have gone over it previously.
It's definitely a great resource to get anyone started with Rails Development.

For Ruby, a great resource is [RubyKoans](http://rubykoans.com/). This helps to dive deeper into Ruby. Also, I was lucky to have asked these question in IRC when Radar was online. He suggested I try and help review his upcoming book, [Rails 4 in Action](http://www.manning.com/bigg2/). So I've purchased the MEAP.
Man this is a great book! Ryan and his co-writers have done a great job with it. It covers a lot of important topics which a lot of other guides and tutorials do not. It takes you from installing your development environment, through basics, testing, authentication, email, deployment, api, and more. It is great! I highly recommend it.

Next in the plan is the [Well Grounded Rubyist, Second Edition](http://www.manning.com/black3/). This book has come well recommended from the community as well. It's the deep dive into Ruby language itself. I've just started reading it recently. And I like it so far.

Note: Aside from learning Ruby, and Ruby on Rails, it is also really important to know HTML and CSS. As a web developer, if you are not familiar with these two items, it's like trying to go to a job interview without wearing any shorts or underwear. Don't even bother. But don't get discouraged, you don't necessarily have to be an expert. But it's absolutely necessary to be pretty familiar with HTML and CSS at the very least. Another one to have on your belt is JavaScript. Pretty much every Web Developer job description will have HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the requirements list.

For the basics in web development, [TeamTreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home) and [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/) have great content to get you in web development shape. There are a plethora of other free content on the net as well.
Also having some experience with installing PHP, MySQL and etc applications on your own is a great bonus.

I'm like buddy buddy with HTML and CSS, as well as HAML, still learning SASS. Over the years I've installed 'just a few' VBulletins, PHPBBs, WordPresses, MySQLs, and even setup my own VPS and configured own servers. Would definitely recommend getting some of this experience under your belt. Although it's not a requirement in most web developer job descriptions. Personally I never liked PHP, ASP, or JavaScript, over the years, certainly not enough to learn either. I've dabbed into a few PHP tutorials.. but I then gave up. I think the biggest reason is, I didn't have a reason to learn it in the first place. There have been all the applications and tools I needed already made. And I had enough know-how to do some light troubleshooting and installing all the apps. JavaScript, however... It has never been more popular as today. And learning JavaScript today, is pretty important, and I would say familiarity with it come hand in hand with HTML, and CSS.

Personally, I'm always in the learning mode. I love learning new technologies and skills. I think it goes without saying that, in the Technology field, if you are not in the "always on - learning mode".. you could get left behind. Most of the skills are of course transferable and last you a life time. But that only goes so far.

So for me, it's reading Well Grounded Rubyist, practicing Ruby and RoR, and somewhere in between learning JavaScript.
