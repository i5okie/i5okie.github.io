Continued. Few months of learning...

If you haven't read the part 1, you can read it [here](http://i5okie.github.io/learningrails/RailsLearningPath/) .

When I've been introduced with the Ruby Language and one of its popular web frameworks, Rails, I've watched some quick tutorial videos and tried the [tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0).
Since then I haven't really touched Ruby, or Rails. I've dabbed into CodeSchool's free Ruby course for a bit. I have made an app or two.. one didn't work out, and the other, with the help of a contributor from IRC, almost completed another app. It works, but It's still under development. I certainly wouldn't call it a finished product, but it works for its purpose.. Aside from that I haven't really done much with rails.

Alright, so the holidays were inspirational. At least in terms of getting me excited about diving into Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. The motivation is there, now what.

I've subscribed to [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/) and [TeamTreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home). From CodeSchool I've went through most of the Ruby learning path. It was alright, but for me it wasn't really cohesive enough. From there I went onto the TreeHouse and completed the Learn Ruby track, as well as Rails Development Track. I really liked these, and felt like I've learned something. However, It didn't feel enough.

Logging onto #rubyonrails and #ruby IRC, I've asked around. I said, okay so I've done these online courses. But it's not enough, what should I do now to upgrade my skills to be able to get a job. IRC community is great, I love it!

The guys and gals on IRC have suggested several great ideas.

One of the more commonly recommended resources, available for free online or purchase for a printed version is the [RailsTutorial book](https://www.railstutorial.org/). I have gone over it previously.
It's definitely a great resource to get anyone started with Rails Development.

For Ruby, a great resource is [RubyKoans](http://rubykoans.com/). This helps to dive deeper into Ruby. Also, I was lucky to have come across when Radar was online. He suggested I try his book, and help review his upcoming book, [Rails 4 in Action](http://www.manning.com/bigg2/).
Man this is a great book! Ryan and his co-writers have done a great job with this. It covers a lot of important topics which a lot of other guides and tutorials do not. It takes you from installing your development environment, through basics, testing, authentication, email, deployment, api, and more. It is great! I highly recommend it.

Next in the plan is the [Well Grounded Rubyist, Second Edition](http://www.manning.com/black3/). This book has come well recommended from the community as well. It's the deep dive into Ruby language itself. I've just started reading it recently. And I like it so far.

Note: Aside from learning Ruby, and Ruby on Rails, it is also really important to know HTML and CSS. As a web developer, if you are not familiar with these two items, it's like trying to job interviews without wearing any underwear and shorts. Don't even bother. Now, you don't necessarily have to be an expert. But it's absolutely necessary to be very familiar with HTML and CSS. Another one to have on your belt is JavaScript. Pretty much every Web Developer job description will have HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript in the requirements list.

For the basics in web development, [TeamTreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home) has great tracks. If you prefer CodeSchool's delivery, they also have great content to get you in web development shape.


Personally, I'm always in the learning mode. I love learning new technologies and skills. I think it goes without saying that, in the Technology field, if you are not in the "always on - learning mode".. you could get left behind. Most of skills are of course transferable and last you a life time. But that goes only so far..


More learning for me.. and I'll update again on my status when I have something new..


to be continued..
