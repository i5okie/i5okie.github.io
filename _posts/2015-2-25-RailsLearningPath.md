A story of discovery, learning, and the journey to the (seemlingly) unreachable goal.

I decided to write about my journey to become a ruby on rails developer.
Normally I do not have any time to write a blog. But I think my situation may be
different, and in some way unique. Perhaps other may find it helpful someday.


If you do a search on ruby on rails, the web doesn't seem to run out of blog posts, 
articles, and other educational content. But the problem I found is that there is no map.


You will never find "The Ultimate Way to Learn Ruby on Rails" there isn't one, and won't be.
There are people who just want to wet their feet and get a quick intro to RoR. And the rest
is somewhere between coming from backgrounds that don't have any computer experience and those
who come from other programming careers. There are people who have an idea of an app they'd like
to make, but once they make that app, they may stop there. And there are people who jump in with
desire to learn as much as possible to try to get a job as ruby on rails programmer.

There is a good blog I came across, from Joshua Kemp, Confessions of an Unlikely Developer.
Joshua was a blacksmith, and decided to switch careers. He wrote a book about how he did that.
"No Degree, No Problem" http://joshuakemp.blogspot.ca/p/my-book.html  it's short, but a good
read. Many people follow in similar steps for their education.

In my case, I have to take a strictly part-time, online approach.

So why? What is my background, which path did I take, and why?
Well in short, I pretty much grew up with computers, a little bit of programming experience, but ended up
in system's enginneer/admin career. If you want, you can read the about me post for more deeper story.
In my family of four, I am the sole bacon provider. I can't take time off work to persue another career.


I was introduced to the world of Rails sometime in 2008-2009. I've followed the tryruby.org
