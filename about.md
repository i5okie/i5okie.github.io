As a Systems Engineer,
I analyse customer's technology needs and help put together complete solutions. I've also designed some fully integrated systems for retail kiosks.

I'm still growing my Web Development skills.
I know HTML, CSS. And I've been using Photoshop off and on since the 90's. I'm actively learning more skills and technologies on TeamTreeHouse, CodeSchool, Lynda and other online resources.

### Interests and stuff


I love photography. At one point I wanted to do photography professinally, so I registered a domain and created my brand, [SimplyKapture](http://simplykapture.com). I've uploaded some of the photos I've taken to [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/simplykapture) for everyone to see. A couple of pictures are actually scans of photos I've taken with the old russian Zenith camera, developed and printed myself at high school lab.

I love cars. I love driving, going for a cruise on a highway, sight seeing.. As a kid I wanted to become a professional race car driver. I've been a part of a Go-Kart club for a few years in Kiev. Rebuilt the motors, built gokarts (Formula K, a.k.a. shifter karts) from scratch. And raced them. I was pretty good at that :) There was a part of my life when I decided to take Autobody Repair course. Learned how to weld, how to bend metal with a hammer and dolly, prep and paint it, etc.. I finished at the top of the class and decided to work at the best autobody shop / best employer. I've worked at a couple shops before finally a job was available at Craftsman Collision Autobody. That was great time, until some drama. At that point I took an exit from that career.

I love music. I love listening to it, and I love playing piano and recording music. Before taking up a career in Autobody Collision Repair, and Computers, I wanted to become a sound engineer and music producer, but the best school around (Art Institute of Vancouver) made me wait a couple years before accepting my application, and first question being how'd you like to pay for a 60k tuition.. I found that schooling is pretty expensive, and it's very difficult to get a good job out of school. It's just as nice being a hobby :)
I've played piano since 2nd grade and went to classical music school in Kiev for a few years.
Since then I've forgotten how to read music as fast as I could years ago. But I still play by ear, and create music on my computer with a midi keyboard. Sometimes I upload my stuff to [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/i5okie).

I love technology. I'm a geek and a nerd. I was lucky to be introduced to computers at an early age in Kiev. I'd play games on Win 3.11 machine at my grandma's work. Then we had a computer at home, I quickly learned ins and outs of that. In highschool I was part of computer club, helped fix teachers computers, supervise computer labs.. even wrote a VB app for students to sign in and sign out of the lab with their student ID cards, to keep track of it for school's administration. yep, nerd. I always have, and always will love technology.

I also really love nature. I love the outdoors, going camping, and not the RV type of camping. Hammock all the way :)
